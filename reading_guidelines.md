The aim of these guidelines is to provide a simple method of reading research
papers in preparation for a paper reading session. They might be of more help to
people that don't do research on a daily basis, but more experienced people
might also find ideas worth trying.

First of all, the methodology for reading papers has already been discussed in
several places. I recommend first reading "[How to Read a Paper]". Here the
author recommends the _three-pass approach_, involving reading the paper quickly
a first time to get an overview of it, a second time to understand key points
and write down the questions you might want to ask the authors, and a third time
to understand the paper at a fundamental level.

Be aware that this method is only one of many others that may suit you better.
(Optionally) check [this][How to read and understand a scientific paper: a guide
for non-scientists] blog post, [this][Any advice on how to read an academic
paper properly? (Reddit)] Reddit thread, and [this][How to Read/Write an
International Conference Paper] presentation, to learn more about them.

Regardless of the chosen method for reading, participants should try to
understand _what_ the authors did (contributions), _how_ they did it at a high
level (methodologies), and _why_ they did (context, motivation). Of course
you're allowed to _not_ understand parts of the paper, but you must read it
carefully enough to have questions. We recommend performing at least 2 passes as
described in the three-pass approach to achieve this.

Doing all this should be enough for having a fruitful paper reading session.
